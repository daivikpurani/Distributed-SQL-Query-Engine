## Overview

This project implements a distributed SQL query engine that can execute SQL queries across multiple worker nodes. The system features:

- **High Performance**: Leverages Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety
- **Distributed Query Processing**: Queries are parsed, planned, and executed across multiple workers
- **Data Sharding**: Automatic data distribution and sharding across worker nodes
- **Fault Tolerance**: Worker failure detection and recovery mechanisms
- **gRPC Communication**: High-performance inter-node communication
- **SQL Support**: Basic SQL operations including SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, and aggregation

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

### 1. Coordinator

- **Query Parser**: Parses SQL queries into internal representations using nom parser combinators
- **Query Planner**: Creates execution plans with shard-aware optimization
- **Shard Manager**: Manages data distribution and shard assignments
- **Query Executor**: Coordinates query execution across workers

### 2. Workers

- **Execution Engine**: Executes query plan nodes on local data
- **Shard Management**: Handles local shard data and ownership
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implements checkpointing and recovery

### 3. Client

- **SQL Client**: Command-line interface for query execution
- **Result Processing**: Handles query results and formatting

## Features

### Core Features

- SQL Query Parsing (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY)
- Distributed Query Planning
- Multi-worker Query Execution
- Data Sharding and Distribution
- Fault Tolerance and Recovery
- Performance Monitoring and Tracing

### Sharding Features

- Hash-based Data Sharding
- Range-based Data Distribution
- Round-robin Distribution
- Automatic Shard Rebalancing
- Shard Migration and Recovery
- Worker Registration and Management

### Query Operations

- Table Scans with Column Projection
- Filter Operations (WHERE clauses)
- Join Operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Aggregation Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- Complex Multi-table Queries

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Distributed-SQL-Query-Engine

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

### Running the System

1. **Start the Coordinator**:

```bash
cargo run --bin coordinator
```

2. **Start Workers** (in separate terminals):

```bash
# Worker 1
cargo run --bin worker -- --worker-id worker1 --port 50052

# Worker 2
cargo run --bin worker -- --worker-id worker2 --port 50053

# Worker 3
cargo run --bin worker -- --worker-id worker3 --port 50054
```

3. **Run Queries**:

```bash
cargo run --bin client -- "SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 30"
```

### Using Scripts

```bash
# Quick start with interactive menu
./scripts/start_system.sh

# Run tests
./scripts/test_system.sh

# Stop all services
./scripts/stop_system.sh
```
